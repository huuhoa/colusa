<p>We have spent most of the last couple of decades helping large
  organizations overhaul their legacy systems. In doing this we've learned a
  great deal about what works and seen many paths that lead to failure. We've
  decided to set aside some time to writing down what we've learned in the form
  of various patterns that we've seen used.</p>

<p>This article acts as the hub for these patterns. Too often we've seen
  organizations stuck on a treadmill of half-done legacy replacement efforts. We
  think the key to breaking this cycle requires four activities done somewhat in
  sequence but mostly iteratively over a company's life. We use these activities
  as our primary structure for organising the patterns that we describe.</p>

<p>We've always believed that effective software development involves gradual
  release of valuable features, and we think the same is true of writing -
  <a href = '/bliki/EvolvingPublication.html'>especially in the age of the
  web</a>. We've started with this narrative article and will gradually
  add patterns as we write up their details, as well as other examples that show
  how they combine. We can't promise any dates, since our priority is our client
  work, which is not short of legacies to displace. If you are interested in
  hearing about more parts of this work as they appear, they will be announced
  on <a href = 'https://www.twitter.com/martinfowler'>Martin's twitter feed</a>,
  and this site's <a href = 'https://martinfowler.com/feed.atom'>RSS
  feed</a>.</p>

<section id = 'TheLegacyReplacementTreadmill'>
<h2>The Legacy Replacement Treadmill</h2>

<p>We have worked with many organizations who have made multiple attempts at
    removing legacy systems. In one fairly typical organization
    they had been through a whole series
    of 3-5 year long modernization programmes. Each time they would define a new
    tech approach, and then work towards that new approach as part of a large
    multi year modernization programme.</p>

<p>At some point during each programme they hit a crisis point where changing
    business needs would overtake their current tech strategy and hence trigger
    the need to start over. Where they had taken a waterfall "big bang" approach to the
    programme this meant abandoning the majority of the work. In other cases
    with more incremental delivery approaches, the approach taken was to just add a
    layer of slightly newer technologies on top of an already complex
    landscape. For both scenarios they were unable to decommission any of their
    legacy stack, key business goals for cost savings and risk reduction remained
    unmet, an all too common outcome for many legacy replacement efforts.</p>

<p>Several key factors were in play in their repeated failures.</p>

<p>Firstly the poor outcomes they were seeing were largely a product of
    the organization; specifically it's leadership, structure and ways of working.
    They thought by just selecting newer technologies, but leaving everything
    else more or less unchanged, that they would get different outcomes from the
    past. In hindsight this was clearly unrealistic.</p>

<p>Secondly the modernization was to be delivered by a large change programme,
    itself comprising a series of projects and teams. These projects were treated
    as orthogonal to any BAU (Business As-Usual) efforts. So BAU delivery of business requirements
    continued against the existing systems while the new project teams delivered
    against a set of requirements agreed at the beginning of the replacement
    programme.</p>

<p>Over time they saw a widening gap between what the business actually
    needed and what was actually signed off at the start of the programme. The longer each
    programme ran for, the more acute this gap between the programme plan
    vs. BAU and future needs. While change control processes were
    in place to add new requirements to a programme, these were hugely
    time-consuming and, due to upfront supplier contracts, prohibitively expensive.</p>

<p>A third key factor in several of the failures was the desire for
    <a href = 'feature-parity.html'>Feature Parity</a> with the existing set of systems and business processes.
    These attempts began by promising to give the business exactly what they
    had today with somehow, behind the covers, the technology having been
    "improved". Having by then seen multiple failures and being concerned about
    disruption, the business leaders felt this was a lower risk strategy.
    The challenge here was even defining and agreeing current "as is"
    functionality was a huge effort and it led to a plan for a large single
    "big bang" cut-over release.</p>

<p>Our observations from this and many other organizations is that
      technology is at most only 50% of the legacy problem, ways of working,
      organization structure and leadership are just as important to
      success.</p>
</section>

<section id = 'BreakingTheCycle'>
<h2>Breaking the cycle</h2>

<p>Clearly there is a need to break out of the cycle of "technology replacement
    programmes". In short organizations need to be able to continue to deliver
    business needs while at the same time replacing outdated technology, all
    against a background of accelerating technological change and a tougher
    competitive climate.</p>

<p>There are a series of approaches we have found can help with these challenges.
    They aid with the challenge of breaking the problem into smaller parts to
    allow delivery of new requirements in parallel with improved technology.
    Broadly speaking they fit into four categories: </p>

<ol>
<li>Understand the outcomes you want to achieve</li>

<li>Decide how to break the problem up into smaller parts</li>

<li>Successfully deliver the parts</li>

<li>Change the organization to allow this to happen on an ongoing basis</li>
</ol>

<section id = 'UnderstandTheOutcomesYouWantToAchieve'>
<h3>Understand the outcomes you want to achieve</h3>

<p>It is vital for an organization to agree the outcomes they want to
    achieve when tackling legacy. While this may seem obvious, all too often
    different parts of an organization can have quite different views on the
    desired outcomes. Most legacy modernization initiatives involve several of
    the outcomes we list below, but it's essential to identify which ones are
    the priority before setting out on the journey.</p>

<section id = 'ReducingTheCostOfChange'>
<h4>Reducing the cost of change</h4>

<p>A key tipping point in many organizations in deciding to tackle legacy is
      that desired business changes start to cost far more than any anticipated
      benefits, either due to opportunity cost (aka delay) or implementation cost.
      An early warning sign is having to spend weeks and 10's or 100's of thousands
      to make a change to a website that brings only a small increase in business
      performance.</p>

<p>At this point it is often no longer possible to justify making
      any changes that don't deliver large returns on investment. In other
      words the state of the technology has started to dictate the size of change
      the business can make. For many organizations this means the difference
      between making a 'BAU' change or having to instigate a larger project.
      These larger projects then become magnets for all the small changes
      that weren't previously justifiable thus increasing their scope, cost
      and risk</p>
</section>

<section id = 'ImprovingTheBusinessProcess'>
<h4>Improving the business process</h4>

<p>We have seen lots of examples of where business processes have evolved
        next to legacy systems, the processes become tightly coupled to the
        way that system works with constraints in the system and often workarounds "off system"
        shaping the business processes people follow to do their jobs.</p>

<p>One example we saw is an airline check-in system that used "green screen"
        terminals, due to constraints in the legacy system the process had to
        be followed in a strict order meaning corrections or mistakes meant
        starting the check-in process over. Also originally the airline had
        not offered connecting flights, when this was added it had to be done
        as a separate workflow in the legacy system due to constraints in that
        technology. So if, at check-in, a passenger did not mention
        they had a connecting flight the wrong process was followed
        including printing the wrong baggage tags, only after this would the
        system flag the connecting flight. The jobs of the check-in staff and
        the passenger's experience could have been much improved by changing
        the process, but this was impossible due to the legacy system.</p>

<p>Given this it should be no surprise that to update and change business
        processes in turn requires changes to the how the supporting technology works.
        Trying to change working processes without altering the technology often
        results in "off system" working where people resort to extracting data
        into spreadsheets or similar, working on it there, before importing the
        data back into the legacy system.</p>

<p>In one organization the whole stock ordering process was actually done
        on a Microsoft Access DB running on the team managers PC. They had
        become frustrated as the legacy system could not support the
        newer working practices of their suppliers. They would do an import
        and export of the data a few times per week, in the meantime the rest
        of the organization would see out of date figures as no one realized
        what was going on.</p>

<p>It is worth noting here that requirements for a replacement system to
        support import and export of data can often have a root cause in this
        kind of workaround.</p>
</section>

<section id = 'RetireAnOldSystem'>
<h4>Retire an old system</h4>

<p>The need to retire an old system is a common reason for legacy modernization.
        This is often driven by challenges in supporting older hardware or software,
        with issues such as escalating support costs and reaching end-of-life
        on support contracts for both hardware and software.</p>

<p>We've found it useful to view the retirement of old systems through the lens of
        the business. So a system being built on old technology is not in of itself
        sufficient reason for replacement. Instead we need to look at the business
        impact this creates such escalating run costs or the risk created by lack of
        support or knowledge of the system.</p>

<p>While some organizations do plan well for obsolescence of older technologies,
        many seem to ignore the issue until it reaches crisis point. In turn, this
        tends to drive organizations towards modernization approaches that seem like
        low disruption options or quick wins, these are usually anti-patterns
        and we describe some of these pitfalls later.</p>

<p>We've been shocked over the years at how many large organizations are
        running their businesses on unsupported hardware and software, buying
        spare parts on eBay is surprisingly common story to hear. If you have
        legacy tech it is well worth doing a proper survey and creating a calendar
        featuring the various end-of-life support dates.</p>

<p>While many organizations give retirement of old systems as a key outcome
        for legacy modernization it is not uncommon to find this doesn't actually
        happen, the legacy is still being used at the end with the associated
        business goals remaining unmet.</p>
</section>

<section id = 'ImminentDisruption'>
<h4>Imminent Disruption</h4>

<p>For some organizations the actual tipping point on tackling legacy can
      arise due to an external factor such as a regulatory change, a new "start up"
      competitor or a significant change by an existing competitor. It's often
      at this point when faced with a "must do" change it becomes clear the money
      and the time required to respond has grown too large.</p>

<p>The external event is the thing that makes clear to an organization's
      leadership that they no longer have the ability to make changes for a
      Proportionate Cost. </p>
</section>

<section id = 'NewerTechnology'>
<h4>Newer technology</h4>

<p>Adoption of newer technology should not be the reason for legacy
      modernization, just having newer tech for it's own sake is rarely a
      key goal for any organization. Rather it should be selected and chosen in
      ways that best meet the current and future needs of the business. A challenge
      here is that pace of technological change is accelerating, the "useful"
      lifetime of technology is getting shorter. The actual definition
      of "useful" depends on the organization, but in general we need to
      consider things such as:</p>

<aside class = 'sidebar' id = 'WeWantToBeLikeNetflix'>
<h4>We want to be like Netflix</h4>

<p>One issue we have seen multiple times is what we call "Netflix Envy".
          This is where the technology leaders of an organization fixate on
          being like Netflix or some other large successful technology company.
          This means they try to emulate the ways of working or choose the same
          technology solutions. While this might be appropriate if they are also
          in the business of streaming movies often times this leads to the
          selection of inappropriate technologies. These technologies often come
          with the ability to scale, but also a higher degree of complexity and cost
          that simply isn't needed for most businesses.</p>
</aside>

<ul>
<li>Allows a competitive advantage</li>

<li>Match competitor or market offerings</li>

<li>Allows a Faster pace of change</li>

<li>Cheaper to change</li>

<li>Has a lower run cost</li>
</ul>

<p>The choices we make today about the best and most useful technology will
      likely be overtaken by better alternatives in a relatively short timeframe.
      This makes getting the decision right on finding technology to meet future
      needs potentially very risky.</p>

<p>A good approach here is to not make any choices that cannot easily be
      "done over" with 2-3 years. This has implications for both technology
      selection but also for overall design and approach. Selecting a huge
      platform with a 5-10 years pay back time is hard to justify when we
      acknowledge this accelerating pace of change.</p>

<section id = 'DecideHowToBreakTheProblemIntoSmallerParts'>
<h3>Decide how to break the problem into smaller parts</h3>

<p>Broadly speaking this involves finding the right "seams" in the current
      business and technical architecture. Importantly, you have to consider how
      elements of the current solution map to different business capabilities. For
      legacy systems this usually means discovering how one large technical
      solution meets multiple business needs and then seeing if it is possible
      to extract individual needs for independent delivery using a new solution. Ideally these
      should be deliverable with minimal dependencies on each other.</p>

<p>A common objection is that finding these seams is too difficult. While we
      agree it is challenging at first, we have found it to be a better approach than
      the alternatives which all too often result in Feature Parity and Big Bang releases.
      We've also observed that many organizations rule out such an approach because
      they are looking at the technology, or the business processes, in isolation.
      Changing just one part of the technology, or updating just one business
      process independently is likely to fail, but if we can consider and then
      implement the two together there are ways to "eat the elephant".</p>

<section id = 'GettingStarted'>
<h4>Getting Started</h4>

<p>Legacy modernization can seem a most daunting proposition at the start of the journey. Like any journey, we
        must first try and understand the initial direction to take. Also, like all journeys, you must start from
        where you are. One common problem we encounter is that we often seem to start in a forest with no view of the
        landscape ahead and therefore no idea of the direction to take. The first step, then, is to climb a tree and
        take a good look around! This means getting as good an understanding of the current systems and architecture
        as possible in the shortest amount of time. This is often super hard to do and it's easy to get bogged down in
        too much detail.

<p>Much has been written on the technique and the authors find it a very

        to production in addtion to mapping out business processes and domains.

        Fortunately there are a number of really useful tools that can be used collaboratively
        to get a good enough understanding to proceed. These tools are discussed

        Notice in this list that we are primarily looking at how business concepts
        are mapping into the systems architecture, and in turn understanding
        how that
        <a href = 'https://martinfowler.com/articles/value-architectural-attribute.html'>architecture supports value generation</a>.
        This is a view that is often missing especially for legacy systems.

        Specifically we find people often stop discovery style activities at the
        boundaries of the legacy systems, "here be dragons", go no further.
        Without crossing the boundary and uncovering how legacy systems support
        (or hinder) business process and activities it is challenging to find
        and extract thin slices to deliver.

<p>Another oft overlooked and very valuable source of information are the users of the systems themselves. In

<h3>Successfully deliver the parts</h3>

<p>The need for faster change and the ability to incrementally deliver and

<h3>Change the organization to allow this to happen on an ongoing basis</h3>

<p>If we step back and look at the whole process of delivering new business
      requirements we can quickly see this is only partly a technology problem. If
      we use newer technology to cut time and cost of building solutions we will
      then highlight any issues around agreeing requirements and getting the change
      into production. </p>

<aside class = 'sidebar' id = 'TheHardestShiftIsTheParadigmShift'>
<h3>The hardest shift is the Paradigm Shift</h3>

<p>20 years after Eli Goldratt, the legendary management consultant,
          published <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goal_(novel)'>"The Goal"</a> he participated in an interview
          for Fortune Small Business where he was asked why it was so many organizations
          are slow to change. His response was to explain that most people will do
          anything they can to avoid as fundamental a change as the Theory of
          Constraints was at the time. He goes on to explain they'll do most
          anything they can to avoid shifting paradigm.</p>

<p>He goes on to suggest that in order to successfully change paradigm
          three things are needed.</p>

<ol>
<li>There must be real pressure to improve results</li>

<li>Everything else within the same paradigm has already been tried and,</li>

<li>They had help with the first step to get going</li>
</ol>
</aside>

<p>We need organization structure and process changes to take
      full advantage of the better technology, and by "Conway's Law" we
      also need an architecture for our technology that facilitates this. If
      teams and their communications are organized around the existing legacy
      solution and processes we may need to reorganize them using the
      <a href = 'https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/inverse-conway-maneuver'>Inverse Conway Maneuver</a> to match the new
      solution and it's architecture.</p>

<p>Legacy systems can constrain and limit the ability to adopt more
        modern engineering practices especially those associated with eXtreme
        Programming and Continuous Delivery. When replacing legacy systems it
        is important to make sure ways of working are changed to ensure we
        don't end up back with a system that is slow, difficult and expensive
        to change.</p>

<p>Legacy is also the product of an organizations
      culture and leadership, without broader change you should expect the
      same outcomes as seen previously.
        We have observed many legacy modernization efforts fail due to
        "corporate antibodies" which spot something new happening and act to
        reject it from the organization.</p>

<p>To give just one example of the way a broad organization can reject
        change; we worked with a very large telecommunications company who wanted
        to build software for mobile phones. The leadership all understood this
        meant much faster feedback cycles and more frequent changes than they
        saw with existing programmes which were focused on fixed infrastructure.</p>

<p>While the leadership understood this no changes were made to existing
        working practice or to the middle management who ran those processes. So
        existing change control processes were rigorously applied. In the end
        the software teams were spending more time filling in change control
        forms and attending change control meetings than they were producing
        software. The "corporate antibodies" worked successfully to reject the
        new way of working. </p>

<p>Organizational change is a big topic with much literature already available,
      the key challenge with legacy is often time related. Few organizations can
      afford to delay legacy modernization while they rework (or rebuild, for
      outsourcing victims) their whole delivery approach along side their
      organization structure and key business processes. While the broader topic
      of organization transformation is beyond our scope we do recommend some
      strategies for applying and protecting new ways of working in the context of
      legacy. If you just change the legacy and do nothing else it is fair to
    expect you'll replacing legacy again with a few years.</p>

<p>There are definitely other strategies and approaches to organization

<section id = 'AnExampleIntegrationMiddlewareRemoval'>
<h2>An example: Integration Middleware Removal</h2>

<p>This example describes how one of our teams used a number of Legacy
    Modernization Patterns to successfully replace integration middleware
    critical to the operation of their client's business as part of a larger
    legacy modernization programme. They combined patterns and refactorings to
    successfully manage risk to the business, and facilitate eating this
    particularly gristly part of the elephant.</p>

<section id = 'UnderstandingTheOutcomes'>
<h3>Understanding the outcomes</h3>

<p>The challenge faced by our team was how to replace integration middleware
    that was out of support, hard to change and very costly with a new
    supportable, flexible solution for the business. Without disrupting or
    putting at risk existing business operations. The middleware in question was
    used to integrate between a backend end system and a store front. Together
    these systems were responsible for selling high value unique products worth
    tens of millions of pounds every day.</p>

<p>This work was a high priority part of a larger programme. The entirety of
    the backend systems supporting the business were being replaced, and the
    store front was also going to be subject to a modernization programme within
    a couple of years.</p>

<p>So, as per step 1 above, the business outcomes the team needed to achieve were defined:
      
<ol>
<li>Improve the business process</li>

<p>How?  This particular integration middleware solution contained a significant amount of logic including rules
          core to the business, like which channel to sell a product on, or how and when to present a product for sale
          within the store front.  This existing system was very hard to change, stifling business innovation, and flaws
        in the logic resulted in issues like having periods when a product was not even on sale!</p>

<li>
          Retire old system as soon as possible</li>

<p>Why?  To reduce existing (and increasing) license and support costs.  Additionally, to mitigate the risk to
          the business created by operating critical functions on aged out of support middleware and database
          technologies.</p>
</ol>

<p>High level system processing: Users individually managed the pricing
      and publishing of products using screens within the legacy backend system.
      For each published product, that system would place a message onto a SwiftMQ
      queue. The integration middleware would consume that message, create its own
      view of the state of the product and call a legacy SOAP API on the store
      front to publish it. Over time, the integration middleware would update the
      state of the product using the API to change how the product was made
      available to customers (e.g. change the product from "preview only" to
      "newly available" etc). When a customer purchased a product the legacy
      storefront would call an API provided by the integration middleware. The
      middleware would update its own state of the product and update the legacy
      system's master database with the sale information.</p>

<section id = 'BreakingTheProblemUpTheFirstSeamAndARefactoring'>
<h3>Breaking the problem up:  the first seam and a refactoring</h3>

<p>During <a href = 'https://martinfowler.com/articles/lean-inception/'>Inception</a> the team ran a workshop
        with people who had deep knowledge of the legacy system, to collaboratively
        visualise both the as-is and to-be software architectures.
        Having done this, they found a technical seam that could be exploited in
        the form of messaging based integration between the legacy backend and the Integration
        Middleware. The Legacy backend, an aging J2EE application, placed "publish product" messages
    onto a queue provided by a very old version of SwiftMQ. The <a href = 'event-interception.html'>Event Interception</a> pattern would be useful here,
    and if implemented as a <a href = 'http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/ContentBasedRouter.html'>Content-Based Router</a>
    would allow control over how messages from the legacy backend were routed,
    and create an option enabling messages to be routed to new systems.</p>

<p>The integration middleware also handled messages coming from the Store
    Front (e.g. for product sales), using JDBC to directly update state in the
    Master Database behind the legacy backend. Together the asynchronous
    messaging via SwiftMQ and the JDBC database updates formed the interface
    between the Legacy Backend and the Integration Middleware. </p>

<div class = 'figure ' id = 'BranchByAbstraction.png'><img alt = 'Branch by abstraction' src = 'BranchByAbstraction.png'></img>

<div class = 'clear'></div>

<p>Although, not spotted at the time, the team were able to use the <a href = 'https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BranchByAbstraction.html'>Branch by Abstraction</a> pattern, at a sub-system scale, as
    the strategy to enable the replacement of the legacy middleware. The
    abstraction layer being the queues and the JDBC. By ensuring that the new
    implementation adhered to that abstraction layer it could be swapped for the
    "flawed supplier" without impacting the business operations.</p>

<p>The first thing the team did was to implement event interception by
    adding an Event Router via a refactoring. </p>

<div class = 'figure ' id = 'IntegrationMiddleWareRemoval_2.png'><img alt = '(P)Refactoring to add Event Interceptor' src = 'IntegrationMiddleWareRemoval_2.png'></img>
<p class = 'photoCaption'></p>
</div>

<div class = 'clear'></div>

<p>The Event Router (1) was created with three main capabilities in
    mind:</p>

<aside class = 'inflow sidebar'>
<p>High level system processing: The term
      <a href = 'https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html'>Refactoring</a> was chosen
      here, as the structure of the system was changed without any observable
      change to behaviour. Now, when a product is published by a user the legacy
      backend system still places a publish message onto a SwiftMQ queue. Instead
      of the integration middleware consuming it, the Event Router now consumes the
      message from that queue and enqueues it, unchanged, onto an alternative
      SwiftMQ queue. The integration middleware consumes the message from this
      alternative queue, a change that was possible via a trivial configuration
      setting.</p>
</aside>

<ol>
<li>To de-queue messages from one SwiftMQ queue and en-queue them onto
      another SwiftMQ queue (2). A trivial change of some config enabled the
      Integration Middleware to consume messages from this new queue(2).</li>

<p>Overall the refactoring left the observable system behaviour unchanged,
      but the Event Router was now part of the Transitional Architecture,
      having been inserted into the message processing pipeline.</p>

<li>The vision for the Event Router was to enable, through configuration,
      routing of messages to an alternative destination - enabling the new
      implementation to process the publish messages. <a href = 'https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/EventInterception.html'>Event Interception</a></li>

<li>The Event Router would also provide a bridge from the old SwiftMQ
      technology to the new ActiveMQ technology chosen for the target
      architecture.</li>
</ol>

<p>Implementing the Event router was not as straight forward as it could
    have been. Integrating with SwiftMQ was problematic due to lack of available
    drivers / libraries and the approach was challenged a number of times. The
    team understood the value of the options that this approach would unlock,
    and completed the work and released into production. They monitored the new
    component in the wild and were set to incrementally enhance its capability
    using new <a href = 'https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html'>Continuous Delivery</a> pipelines.</p>

<h3>Successfully deliver the parts:  building out the functionality, maintaining the contract</h3>

<div class = 'clear'></div>

<p>The new Store Front Manager(1) was now iteratively built out by the team
    . Relevant to this example, that build included the Master Database
    Adapter (2) implementing the Legacy Mimic pattern. This was required as part
    of the abstraction layer, to update the Master Database with sales
    information received from the Store Front. As the Event Router did not
    transform messages, a Legacy Event Adapter (3) (<a href = 'http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/MessageTranslator.html'>Message Translator</a>) was created to transform messages
    into a new format, not exposing the legacy world to the new, and aligning to
    the principles of the new architecture. The Legacy Storefront <a href = 'https://martinfowler.com/bliki/RequiredInterface.html'>Adapter</a>(4) was also implemented between the new Store
    Front Manager(1) and the Legacy Store Front to isolate the new
    implementation from future changes that would be coming when the store front
    was replaced.</p>

<p>A new API was introduced on the Legacy Store Front (5) that the new Store
    Front Manager was to use. Additionally, a feature was added enabling call
    backs for products published on the new API to be sent to the new Store
    Front Manager's adapter (4). Critically, this enabled the legacy
    implementation and the new implementation to be run in parallel.</p>

<section id = 'SuccessfullyDeliverThePartscont.TransitioningIntoLiveService-UsingASecondSeam'>
<h3>Successfully deliver the parts (cont.): transitioning into live service - using a second seam</h3>

<p>With all of the pieces in place the business were able to test the new
      solution, but how to roll it out into live service <b>in a risk managed way</b>.</p>

<p>To do this they took advantage of another seam - this time using the
    Segment by Product pattern. The Event Router was enhanced to add
    configurable routing (6) by product type as well as by unique
    product IDs. The team were able to test the publishing, management and sale
    of individual products by ID, and then over time configure the router with
    progressively more and more product types, essentially increasing the
    percentage of products handled by the new solution.</p>

<p>When all products were being handled by the new systems, the legacy
    Integration Middleware was decommissioned, realising the significant &#xA3;
    saving in license, support and datacenter hosting fees.</p>

<div class = 'figure ' id = 'IntegrationMiddleWareRemoval_5.png'><img alt = 'Legacy Gone' src = 'IntegrationMiddleWareRemoval_5.png'></img>
<p class = 'photoCaption'></p>
</div>

<div class = 'clear'></div>

<aside class = 'inflow sidebar'>
<p>High level system processing: Unless the business had specified otherwise,
        processing of a given product proceeded as before. For products where the
        business were happy to route them through the new system the processing was
        now as follows. A publish message was placed on a SwiftMQ queue. The event
        router would check the message payload and inspect the product manufacturer.
        If configured the Event Router would place this message unaltered onto an
        ActiveMQ queue. The Legacy Event Adapter transformed the message into a
        business event aligned to principles from the target architecture. The New
        Storefront Manager application would store its own representation of the
        product and forward a command message via a queue for the product to be
        published. The Legacy Storefront Adapter consumes that command, and calls
        the new v2 API on the Legacy Storefront. </p>

<p>As required by the business,
        users can now manipulate how the products are presented on the storefront in
        addition to the manager changing this overtime by issuing new commands.</p>

<p> When a product (published via the v2 API) is sold, the Legacy Store Front
        calls back to an API provided by the Legacy Storefront Adapter, which
        transforms the call into a business event and places that event onto an
        ActiveMQ queue. The New Storefront Manager, and Master Database Adapter
        consume these events. The new storefront manager updating its internal state
        of the product, and the Master Database Adapter updating the legacy Master
        Database with the sale information.</p>

<h3>Changing the organisation to allow this to happen on an ongoing basis</h3>

<p>Our teams had already been working with the client, in another part of the organisation and had already
        successfully displaced a different legacy system.</p>

<p>At an engineering level across the organisation continuous delivery and good supporting quality practices
        were now the established norm, and a microservices style architecture enabled regular and independent deployment
        of containerised services onto a cloud based platform.</p>

<p>The teams on the new programme, working with new stakeholders, needed to take this other part of the business
        on the same "agile and CD" journey, and early risk managed releases enabled trust to be earned.  Over time it
        was possible to demonstrate how new engineering and quality practices including CD were mitigating the same
        risks that had historically resulted in higher levels of bureaucracy and governance.  So less frequent,
        larger scope releases were also displaced by smaller, more frequent, higher confidence deployments, and
        toggled releases to the business when they were ready to take on the changes.

<section id = 'ClosingThoughts'>
<h3>Closing thoughts</h3>

<p>Of course there was significantly more complexity and
        integration requirements than implied by the simplified story above. An example
        of the need for Archeology introduced itself shortly after testing the
        new implementation in production. A number of business critical management
        information reports did not tally - products were "getting lost". </p>

<p>After much digging the team found that the database used by the
        Integration Middleware (for storing the state of long running business
        transactions) was replicated to the organisation's data warehouse. Via a number
        batch jobs, stored procedures and views this data was made available for use
        within the business critical KPI reports. </p>

<div class = 'figure ' id = 'LegacyModernisationExample_Archeology.png'><img alt = 'LegacyModernizationExample_Archeology' src = 'LegacyModernisationExample_Archeology.png'></img>
<p class = 'photoCaption'></p>
</div>

<div class = 'clear'></div>

<p>Additional Legacy mimics were required to ensure that these reports
        did not break. The team used a
        <a href = 'http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/WireTap.html'>Wire Tap</a> on
        sales messages coming from the Store Front and using JDBC injected the data into
        appropriate tables within the data warehouse. These additional mimics
        also became part of the transitional architecture, and would be removed when
        possible. </p>

<p>The approach of branch by abstraction, and use of patterns and practices
    described above was one intended to lower risk. </p>

<p>Using Event Interception (technical seam), Legacy Mimics and Transitional Architecture
      enabled the client to break the problem up.  Then segmenting by product (business seam),
      in this case product type, enabled fine control of the wider rollout and further management of risk.
      Overall the approach allowed the business to proceed with the system replacement at the pace that was
    comfortable to them.</p>

<p>The approach allowed risk to be managed, but came at a cost.  A question to consider is therefore
      "What value does the business place on this risk mitigation?" Being explicit and quantifying it, will allow
      a team to track investments against it.
      The event router and legacy mimics were part of an investment in a transitional architecture intended to manage
      risk. Their roles were to create options enabling risk to be managed. It can be very easy for such work to be
      seen as "throw away" - and as such a cost to be avoided wherever possible. Be explicit and transparent in this
    "value of risk mitigation" vs "cost of transitional architecture" trade-off.</p>
